# Space Shooter
This project is based on a tutorial called [Build a Space Shooter with Phaser 3](https://yorkcs.com/category/interesting-bits/build-space-shooter-phaser-3/) by [@jaredyork](https://github.com/jaredyork).

## Installation

Install the dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nicolasiensen/space-shooter.git
cd space-shooter

Parcel is a _blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler_, which we can use to bundle the game source code, and host it in a local server.

```shell
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

## Start the game

```shell
parcel index.html
```
